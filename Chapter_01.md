## Chapter 01 - _New Born Baby_

There you are, nice to meet you again. Ready to get some **basic** stuff here aren't you?
Here we go..

Having an updated nano from _brew_, will get you many `*.nanorc` in /usr/local/share/nano/
>_So, what's about it?_

Well, it may be look smarter if you type something and the text change it's color, right?
It's called _syntax highlighting_

>_Can you repeat?_

Um.. Okay, it's not basic.. _(damn, they'll figure out how dumb I am now...)_

Okay, back to the basic shall we?


#### A. Open nano editor
   - Open terminal, then type **nano**

![Nano-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85201626/180642708-44b96556-627e-4695-ad21-eafe1ec18820.jpeg)

#### B. Where's the manual?
  - Press **F1 key** or **^G** (Ctrl + G)
>_Okay, now I see some of these:_ " Meta-key sequences are notated with 'M-' " _What is Meta-key?_

Meta-key is an **`Esc`** key. Example: if you want to **undo**, and you see in the help mode is **`M-U`**, so you press **`Esc+U`**

The rest can be read at the help text (manual).

Oh, there's more, in the manual there is some of these: `^G     (F1)     Display this help text`

Means besides pressing **`Ctrl+G`** you can invoke command using **`F1`** too!

I usually saving my work using **`F3`**, and close the document using **`F2`**

>Hell no! What else? Can i use Cmd+C to copy and Cmd+V to paste?

Well, sort of.. Do you mean "How to copy and paste in nano"?

#### C. Copy and Paste in nano editor (and cutting)
##### Copy and Paste
There are 2 ways to do it --_for I don't know what else, Im still dummy you remember?_
  1. The primitive way: You can copy and paste using regular hotkey, _IF_, you **`block`** _(click and drag)_ the text on the terminal or other app **`using mouse`**, copy it using **`Cmd+C`** and paste it using **`Cmd+V`**.
  2. The coder way: hold **`SHIFT`**, press **`right arrow`** to block some text inside nano, then press **`Esc+6`** to copy, last press **`Ctrl+U`** to paste.

##### Cut and Paste
Well, I'd love to cut in nano. Just press **`Ctrl+K`** and wow! It's cutting a whole line! I'm amazed at the first time using it.

Cut

Cut more

Cut few more times, many lines cutted

and.. where's the text gone? --Well, its in the _cutbuffer_. Same when you copy using **`Alt+6`**, the copied text also in the _cutbuffer_.

Paste it using **`Ctrl+U`**. Done.

>Okay, I get it. Now, if I want to make some file not in current directory, do I have to _cd_ to the target directory first?

(Ow, what a question, are you advance user or what? _Damn_, I have to _Google_ it now..)

Good questions, answer is: you don't have to change directory --thanks _Google_.

You can make a file with 3 ways --_again, for I don't know what else..._
   1. `nano filename`
      - create "filename" in current directory. You can spesify file extension too, like: filename.txt, filename.sh, etc
   2. `nano /Document/FolderA/FolderAa/FolderAa1/filename`
      - create "filename" in /Document/FolderA/FolderAa/FolderAa1/ directory.
   3. `nano` --then `drag a desired folder from Finder to the terminal`, then type the desired "filename"
      - create "filename" in folder you've dragged to the terminal
