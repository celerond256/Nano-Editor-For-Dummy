# Nano-Editor-For-Dummy
>Nano editor for dummy who wants to be a little _byte_ smarter...

## Introduction
#### So, you have _nano editor_ preinstalled on your hackintosh, and till now doesn't know what _she_ can do?
>You're not alone..

## Requirements
   - Desire to be smarter
   - Always ask yourself, _is this person owning the repo is smarter than you_ --> if _YES_, then continue reading...

#### As an ordinary person, first thing I would do is:
1. Updating nano editor
    - Open terminal
    - $ brew install nano
 >Oh, what is _**brew**_ anyway? It's a package manager, it can install.. Nah, just install it from [here](https://brew.sh)

2. Use nano editor
    - Still in terminal
    - $ nano wtf.txt
3. There you go, you'll look smarter when people see you typing inside a terminal...
4. **That's it?** --of course not, I'll make chapters for this repo, to show you how smart I am... (maybe)

## Chapter
- **Chapter 01** - _New Born Baby_
